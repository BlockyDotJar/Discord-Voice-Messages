## Requirements

* You have at least installed Java **19**
* A Discord bot token
* Your bot has access to following intents: `GUILD_VOICE_STATES`, `GUILD_MESSAGES` and `GUILD_MEMBERS`
* A Tixte API-key, session-token and default domain
* You have Gradle installed on your computer
* Basic Java, JDA and Tixte4J knowledge

## Contribution

If you want to contribute to this project, make sure to base your branch off of our **developer** branch
and create your PR into that **same** branch.
<br>**We will be rejecting any PRs, which are not based to the developer branch!**
<br>It is very possible that your change might already be in development or you missed something.

More information can be found at the [contributing](https://github.com/BlockyDotJar/Discord-Voice-Messages/wiki/Contributing) wiki page.

### Deprecation Policy

When a feature is introduced to replace or enhance existing functionality we might deprecate old functionality.

A deprecated method/class usually has a replacement mentioned in its documentation which should be switched to.
<br>Deprecated functionality might or might not exist in the next minor release. (Hint: The minor version is the `MM` of `XX.MM.RR(-TT.ZZ)` in our version format)

It is possible that some features are deprecated without replacement, in this case the functionality is no longer supported by either the Tixte4J/JDA(-C) structure
due to fundamental changes or due to Tixte-API/Discord-API changes that cause it to be removed.

We highly recommend discontinuing usage of deprecated functionality and update by going through each minor release instead of jumping.
<br>For instance, when updating from version `1.0.0-beta.1` to version `1.0.0-rc.2` you should do the following:

- Update to `1.0.0-beta.ZZ` and check for deprecation
- Update to `1.0.0-rc.2` and check for deprecation

The `RR` in version `1.0.RR` should be replaced by the latest version that was published for `1.0`, you can find out which the latest
version was by looking at the [release page](https://github.com/BlockyDotJar/Discord-VoiceMessages/releases)

These are only the libraries, which we have in our [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/BlockyDotJar/Discord-Voice-Messages/blob/main/build.gradle.kts), but we are using [all libraries](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA#dependencies), which the original JDA uses too.
